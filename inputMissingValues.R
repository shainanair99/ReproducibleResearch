##First, we calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with NAs)
sum(is.na(df$steps))

## [1] 2304

df_impute <- df
ndx <- is.na(df_impute$steps)
int_avg <- tapply(df_ign$steps, df_ign$interval, mean, na.rm=TRUE, simplify=T)
df_impute$steps[ndx] <- int_avg[as.character(df_impute$interval[ndx])]

new_dailysum <- tapply(df_impute$steps, df_impute$date, sum, na.rm=TRUE, simplify=T)

hist(x=new_dailysum,
     col="red",
     breaks=20,
     xlab="daily steps",
     ylab="frequency",
     main="The distribution of daily total (with missing data imputed)")
